# Sound Radix 32 Lives Review: A Lifesaver for 32-bit Plug-ins
 
If you are a Mac user who has upgraded to a 64-bit DAW, such as Logic Pro X, Cubase, Ableton Live or Studio One, you may have encountered a problem: some of your favorite 32-bit plug-ins no longer work. This can be frustrating, especially if you have invested a lot of money and time in those plug-ins, or if you have old projects that rely on them.

Fortunately, there is a solution: Sound Radix 32 Lives. This is a transparent 32-bit to 64-bit Audio Units and VST plug-ins adapter, which enables you to run your legacy 32-bit plug-ins in your latest 64-bit DAW. It works with virtually all 64-bit Audio Units and VST host applications, including Logic Pro X, Cubase, Ableton Live and Studio One[^4^] [^2^].
 
## How does it work?
 
Sound Radix 32 Lives is very easy to use. Once installed, it will scan your system for 32-bit plug-ins and present them in a list. You simply select which ones you want to convert, then hit the Resurrect button. A quick look in the Components folder reveals that duplicates have been created, but with âx64â added to the file name along with a 32 Lives icon[^4^].
 
You can now load old Logic 9 arrangements in Logic X and your 32-bit plug-ins will appear like normal. Apart from a very minor GUI wiggle when a window is moved, the results are practically seamless â much better, in fact, than Appleâs own 32-bit bridge solution for running Logic 9 in 64-bit mode[^4^].
 
Older sessions saved with your 32-bit DAW will fully load into your 64-bit DAW version, including all presets, parameters and automation; no special re-wiring or routing is required. All your 32-bit-only plug-ins will be displayed in the plug-ins menu as they always have been[^2^].
 
## What are the benefits?
 
Sound Radix 32 Lives has many benefits for Mac users who want to enjoy the advantages of a 64-bit DAW without losing their 32-bit plug-ins. Some of these benefits are:
 
- It enables you to run your favorite 32-bit-only plug-ins, such as Vanguard, VB3 and TC PowerCore plug-ins, in your latest 64-bit DAW[^2^].
- It is fully compatible with older sessions, loading all existing presets, parameters and automation[^2^].
- It has ultra-low latency and high CPU efficiency[^2^].
- It has a transparent GUI workflow that doesn't require additional clicks and windows[^2^].
- It supports a large list of plug-ins and instruments. A full list and a trial version are available from the Sound Radix website, so you can test whether your plug-ins will work[^4^].
- It is compatible with OS X Snow Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks, Yosemite and El Capitan[^2^].

## What are the drawbacks?
 
Sound Radix 32 Lives is not perfect. There are some drawbacks that you should be aware of before buying it. Some of these drawbacks are:

- It costs $99, which may seem expensive for some users who only need to convert a few plug-ins[^4^].
- It only converts Audio Units and not VST plug-ins on Mac[^4^].
- It does not support macOS Catalina or newer versions[^1^].
- It may not work with some rare or obscure plug-ins that have compatibility issues[^4^].
- It requires an internet connection for authorization[^2^].

## Conclusion
 
Sound Radix 32 Lives is an essential and elegant solution for Mac users who want to use their old 32-bit plug-ins in their new 64-bit DAWs. It is
